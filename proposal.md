# Project Proposal

## Description

This is a trivia game. You get asked questions and you choose the answer you feel is right. Your score is recorded . You also get rewards for your achievements.
## Need to have list

- questions with options in such a way that you cannot go to the next question without clicking an option and you cannot choose two options per question
- Display answers correct and answers wrong at the end of each category
- different question and categories
- Using class to hold questions attributes
- A home button to go back to the home page after each category

## Nice to have list

- sound effects
- Great UI
- random code generator to enter into the quiz
- Randomizes the question

## Some difficult problem
- It was difficult to differentiate the right and the wrong answer in a class until I had to add an object from the constructor into my button functions because before then it was not an element in the button function.
