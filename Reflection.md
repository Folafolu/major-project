## What was the most Challenging Part
- My most challenging part was creating the class and setting up attributes in it because most of my project was based on the class function
- It was difficult to differentiate the right and the wrong answer in the class I created, until I had to add an object from the constructor into my button functions. Before then, it was not an element in the button function. 

## Anything I would do differently if I started now
I wouldn't do anything differently because I was very productive with the way I built this program, I worked on the ability for the code to work before I worked on UI and other stuff. But i'll say, if i had more time I will have spent more time thinking on what i was going to do before actually coding it

## What am I most proud of
- I am proud of my ability for this program to work with as much ease as possible. If i hadn't been thought how to use the class function, i wouldn't have benn able to make this work. 
- I'm also proud that i completed everything in my needs to have list and touched a little in my wants to have list
